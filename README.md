# Python Wikipedia Game
"The Wiki Game, also known as the Wikipedia race, is a hypertextual game designed to work specifically with Wikipedia. It requires only a computer, Internet access, a web browser and (optionally) a time-keeping device to play." (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game)
